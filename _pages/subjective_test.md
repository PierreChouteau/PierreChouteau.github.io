# The MUSHRA test
For evaluating our algorithmon real audio, we lack the ground truth wich is the isolated instrument. Therefore we need another mean of evaluation, and we built a subjective test. The test is available for now [here](https://sourceseparation2022-2023.github.io/webmushra/).

<!-- Here include some description of Mushra and Webmushra -->

Subjective evaluation procedures involve human evaluators assigning scores to the output of the source separation system. The state-of-the-art for subjective evaluation is called Multiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA), the test should be developed following the International Telecommunications Unionâ€™s recommendations ITU. It is ideally performed by well-trained audio engineers in a sound-treated room and compares the qualities of various conditioned sound files with a reference. Among the files to compare should be a hidden reference and at least one hidden anchor, an intentionally bad variant of the audio which is traditionally obtained by low-pass filtering. These are meant to provide boundaries across evaluators, and raise a flag if any rating may have been incorrectly performed.
